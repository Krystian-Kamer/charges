<h2>Charges ðŸ’¸</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Project was created by using React and Tailwind. </li>
  <li>This is a fee management application. </li>
  <li>I wanted to create a project that would make my life easier. </li>
  <li>It's a full responsive website.</li>
  <li>In this application You can add charges, delete charges, check If You paid for a charge in actual month.</li>
  <li>You can also rename specific charge.</li>
  <li>I used localStorage, so your fees will be save and You can always come back to them.</li>
  <li>I used also react-toastify and swiper libraries in this app.</li>
</ul>

<h4>To recreate the site locally, just clone my repository and type npm install in terminal and then npm run dev.</h4>
<h4>Feel free to explore my site and if You have any questions You can simply write to me. </h4>
